## 3. Sandboxed Execution & Client-Side Security Model
The `.ldocx` format executes rich client-side computational elements, charts, 3D scenes, and custom JSX sandboxes. To protect users from malicious document payloads:

1. **AST Schema Validation**:
   All `.ldocx` containers (`document.json`) must strictly adhere to the typed AST schema before any node is mounted into the DOM.
2. **Client-Side Sandbox Isolation**:
   Custom code blocks run within an isolated function execution boundary (`executeCustomSandboxCode`) with restricted global scopes, blocking unsafe prototype poisoning and cross-site execution.
3. **SHA-256 Container Integrity Checksums**:
   Every packaged `.ldocx` archive embeds a `checksum.sha256` manifest validating `manifest.json` and `document.json` to detect tampering or in-transit corruption.
4. **Zero Server Payload Transmission**:
   Document parsing, 3D model geometry generation, and presentation rendering occur 100% in local browser memory (RAM), eliminating backend data leakage.
